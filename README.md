# PF2e Alchemist Remaster Duct Tape

> [!IMPORTANT]
> PF2e system has been updated with the Player Core 2 Alchemist features. This module still functions and provides added functionality and quality of life features aimed to streamline playing Alchemist.

A quality of life module to automate features for the Alchmist remaster from Player Core 2.

## Known issues

- If multiple players are owner of an actor they will also get prompted to add vials and learn formulas.

## Features

For a list of features and settings please view [the Wiki](https://github.com/thejoester/pf2e-alchemist-remaster-ducttape/wiki)

## Requests

This is still sort of a work in progress, and by no means a full release. I have made changes that affect my players the most at the moment. I expect when the Alchemist Player Core 2 changes are implemented in the PF2e system, parts of this module will be obsolete. 

In the meantime if you have a request for a work around fix for an Alchemist feature, please submit one in the [Issues Page](https://github.com/thejoester/pf2e-alchemist-remaster-ducttape/issues).
